Reviewing a Log4cxx release
===================

The review should confirm the uploaded source code is not corrupt and
is identical to the package generated by the Github action.
The steps below use version 1.3.0 as an example.

Prerequisites
----------

* [GNU Privacy Guard](https://www.gnupg.org/) is installed on your system
* A C++ compiler is available on your system
* cmake, APR and APR-Util are installed on your system
* You have imported the [Apache Logging KEYS file](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/logging/KEYS)

Steps
-----

1. Download, verify check-sums, verify signatures, build and test
    - Save to your system the verification script https://github.com/apache/logging-log4cxx/validate-release.sh
    - Run the script
    - For success, the final output line needs to include:
        - `100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 62`
1. Confirm the artifacts were sourced from Github
    - Got to https://github.com/apache/logging-log4cxx/commits/v1.3.0-RC1
    - The log of the most recent commit can be accessed
      using the "Details" link in the pop-up window shown
      when the green tick is clicked.
    - The artifacts are available in the Github action log
      under the "Run action/upload-artifact" step of
      the "Generate release files" Github action.
    - Click the link next to `Artifact download URL:`
    - `mkdir /tmp/log4cxx-github`
    - `cd /tmp/log4cxx-github`
    - `unzip "~/Downloads/Upload release files.zip"`
    - `diff /tmp/log4cxx{,-github}/apache-log4cxx-1.3.0.tar.gz.sha512`
    - `diff /tmp/log4cxx{,-github}/apache-log4cxx-1.3.0.zip.sha512`
