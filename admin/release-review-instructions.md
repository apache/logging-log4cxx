Reviewing a Log4cxx release
===================

The review should confirm the uploaded source code is not corrupt and
is identical to the package generated by the Github action.
The steps below use version 1.3.1 as an example.

Prerequisites
----------

* [GNU Privacy Guard](https://www.gnupg.org/) is installed on your system
* A C++ compiler is available on your system
* cmake, APR and APR-Util are installed on your system
* You have imported the [Apache Logging KEYS file](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/logging/KEYS)

1. Download, verify check-sums, verify signatures, build and test
    - Save to your system the verification script https://github.com/apache/logging-log4cxx/blob/master/admin/validate-release.sh
    - Run the script
    - For success, the final output line needs to include:
        - `100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 62`
1. Download the packaged release files from Github
    - Open https://github.com/apache/logging-log4cxx/commits/v1.3.1-RC1 in your web browser
    - Click the green tick mark on the top commit
        - The `All checks have passed` pop-up window will display

        - The numbered steps will display
    - Click the link next to `Artifact download URL:`
        - The browser will download the file `release_files.zip` onto your system
1. Confirm the artifacts were sourced from Github using these commands
    - `mkdir /tmp/log4cxx-github`
    - `cd /tmp/log4cxx-github`
    - `unzip "$HOME/Downloads/release_files.zip"`
    - `diff /tmp/log4cxx-{1.3.1,github}/apache-log4cxx-1.3.1.tar.gz.sha512`
    - `diff /tmp/log4cxx-{1.3.1,github}/apache-log4cxx-1.3.1.zip.sha512`
