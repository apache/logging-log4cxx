As of version 0.11.0, the only supported build system for Log4cxx is CMake.
Have a look at the [Building with CMake] page for more information.
If you have trouble building, either [create an issue]
or send a message to the [users mailing list](mailto:log4cxx-user@logging.apache.org).

Various Linux distributions already have Log4cxx as part of their package
managers - consult the documentation for your distribution to determine
if a package already exists.

See the following pages for information on building Log4cxx:

* @subpage dependencies
* @subpage build-cmake
* @subpage build-vcpkg
* @subpage supported-systems
