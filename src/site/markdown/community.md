# Getting help {#support}

If you are using an older version, search the [change log], [JIRA] and [mailing list archives]
to determine whether your problem has been fixed some time ago.

If you already digged through the code and found a problem in the Log4cxx implementation
or the Log4cxx build scripts, feel free to directly raise an issue in [Github Issues].
*Please don't just open bugs only because things don't work for you*,
some issues simply aren't bugs in the code base of the project or it's build tools,
but may have a lot of different other reasons.

If things really only don't work and you don't have any clue why,
please use the [official support channels],
i.e., [usage mailing list](mailto:log4cxx-user@logging.apache.org),
[developer mailing lists](mailto:log4cxx-dev@logging.apache.org)
or [GitHub Discussions] instead.

# Reporting a security issue {#security}
