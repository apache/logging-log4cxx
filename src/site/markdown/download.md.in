# Download Apache Log4cxx ${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_VERSION}

  Apache Log4cxx ${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_VERSION} is distributed under the [Apache License, version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

  The link in the Mirrors column should display a list of available mirrors with a
  default selection based on your inferred location.  If you do not see that page,
  try a different browser.  The checksum and signature are links to
  the originals on the main distribution server.

|                         | Mirrors | Checksum | Signature |
|-------------------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| Apache Log4cxx ${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_VERSION} (tar.gz) | [source archive](${LOG4CXX_SOURCE_MIRROR_URL}.tar.gz) | [sha512](${LOG4CXX_DISTRIBUTION_URL}.tar.gz.sha512) [sha256](${LOG4CXX_DISTRIBUTION_URL}.tar.gz.sha256) | [GnuPG signature](${LOG4CXX_DISTRIBUTION_URL}.tar.gz.asc) |
| Apache Log4cxx ${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_VERSION} (zip) | [source archive](${LOG4CXX_SOURCE_MIRROR_URL}.zip) | [sha512](${LOG4CXX_DISTRIBUTION_URL}.zip.sha512) [sha256](${LOG4CXX_DISTRIBUTION_URL}.zip.sha256) | [GnuPG signature](${LOG4CXX_DISTRIBUTION_URL}.zip.asc) |

It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP or SHA512 signatures.
Please read [Verifying Apache HTTP Server Releases](https://httpd.apache.org/dev/verification.html) for more
information on why you should verify our releases.

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the [KEYS](${APACHE_LOGGING_DISTRIBUTION_URL}/KEYS)
as well as the asc signature file for the relevant distribution. Make sure you get these files from the
[main distribution directory](${APACHE_LOGGING_DISTRIBUTION_URL}/), rather than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using:

~~~
% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify ${LOG4CXX_SOURCE_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME}.tar.gz.asc ${LOG4CXX_SOURCE_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME}.tar.gz
~~~

* ${LOG4CXX_SOURCE_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME} is signed by ${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_MANAGER} (${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_MANAGER_KEY})

Alternatively, you can verify the SHA512 signature on the files. A unix program called sha512 or sha512sum is included
in many unix distributions.
