# Supported options

| Option                 | Usage |
|------------------------|-------|
| LOG4CXX_WCHAR_T=no   | Enable wchar_t API methods, choice of yes (default), no.                                    |
| LOG4CXX_UNICHAR=yes  | Enable UniChar API methods, choice of yes, no (default).                                    |
| LOG4CXX_CFSTRING=yes | Enable CFString API methods, requires Mac OS/X CoreFoundation, choice of yes, no (default). |
| BUILD_TESTING=off    | Do not build tests.  Tests are built by default                                             |
| BUILD_FUZZERS        | Enabled by default if `BUILD_TESTING=ON` and libFuzzer is found.                            |
| BUILD_SITE=OFF       | Set to `ON` to enable the project website build. Requires Doxygen.                          |
| BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=off| Build Log4cxx as a static library. A dynamically linked Log4cxx library is built by default. Any compilation unit that includes a Log4cxx header must define LOG4CXX_STATIC.             |
| APU_STATIC=yes       | Link to the APR-Util static library. By default, the Log4cxx shared library is linked to the APR-Util shared library. If BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=off, the static APR-Util library is used.     |
| APR_STATIC=yes       | Link to the APR static library. By default, the Log4cxx shared library is linked to the APR shared library. If BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=off, the static APR library is always used.        |
| LOG4CXX_TEST_PROGRAM_PATH=path | An extra path to prepend to the PATH for test programs.  Log4cxx requires zip, sed, and grep on the PATH in order for the tests to work properly.                          |
| PREFER_BOOST=on      | Prefer the Boost version of dependent libraries over standard library |
| LOG4CXX_QT_SUPPORT=ON | Enable QString API and log4cxx::qt namespace methods, requires QtCore, choice of ON, OFF (default).                   |
| LOG4CXX_EVENTS_AT_EXIT=ON | Prevent static data cleanup to allow event logging during application exit. |
| LOG4CXX_FORMAT_NAMESPACE=std | Make the `LOG4CXX_[level]_FMT` macros use [std::format](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format/format) by default.  |

# Examples

## Unix type systems

Make sure cmake (3.13+), g++, gzip, zip and make are available.
On a Debian system these may be installed by:
~~~
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake gzip zip
~~~

1. Using the distro provided APR libraries
and the cmake cursors UI to configure Log4cxx options.
~~~
$ apt-get install libapr1-dev libaprutil1-dev
$ wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/logging/log4cxx/${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_VERSION}/apache-log4cxx-${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_VERSION}.tar.gz
$ tar xf apache-log4cxx-${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_VERSION}.tar.gz
$ cd apache-log4cxx-${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_VERSION}
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ccmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
~~~

2. Install libraries locally in $HOME/libraries and
statically bind APR into the Log4cxx DSO.
~~~
$ wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/apr/apr-${APACHE_APR_RELEASE_VERSION}.tar.bz2
$ tar xf apr-${APACHE_APR_RELEASE_VERSION}.tar.bz2
$ cd apr-${APACHE_APR_RELEASE_VERSION}
$ CFLAGS=-fPIC ./configure --prefix=$HOME/libraries
$ make install
$ cd $HOME
$ wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/apr/apr-util-${APACHE_APR_UTIL_RELEASE_VERSION}.bz2
$ tar xf apr-util-${APACHE_APR_UTIL_RELEASE_VERSION}.bz2
$ cd apr-util-${APACHE_APR_UTIL_RELEASE_VERSION}
$ CFLAGS=-fPIC ./configure --with-apr=$HOME/libraries --prefix=$HOME/libraries
$ make install
$ cd $HOME
$ wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/logging/log4cxx/${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_VERSION}/apache-log4cxx-${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_VERSION}.tar.gz
$ tar xf apache-log4cxx-${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_VERSION}.tar.gz
$ cmake -S apache-log4cxx-${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_VERSION} -B build/log4cxx -DAPR_STATIC=yes -DAPU_STATIC=yes -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/libraries -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/Libraries -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ cmake --build build/log4cxx --target install
~~~

## Windows

1. The easiest way to get dependencies installed is to use vcpkg.
Follow the directions at https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start-windows and then install
the dependencies needed using `vcpkg install apr apr-util`.

2. Building from source in \%HOMEPATH\%/Libraries.
Use your browser to download source for Expat from github, APR and APR-Util from ${APACHE_APR_DOWNLOAD_URL}
and Log4cxx from ${LOG4CXX_SOURCE_MIRROR_URL}.
Extract the source code into directories libexpat, apr-${APACHE_APR_RELEASE_VERSION}, apr-util-${APACHE_APR_UTIL_RELEASE_VERSION} and apache-log4cxx-${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_VERSION}.
~~~
> cd %HOMEPATH%/Libraries
> cmake -S libexpat/expat -B buildtrees/expat -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%HOMEPATH%/Libraries/installed
> cmake --build buildtrees/expat --target install --config Release
> cmake -S apr-${APACHE_APR_RELEASE_VERSION} -B buildtrees/apr -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%HOMEPATH%/Libraries/installed
> cmake --build buildtrees/apr --target install --config Release
> set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%HOMEPATH%/Libraries/installed
> cmake -S apr-util-${APACHE_APR_UTIL_RELEASE_VERSION} -B buildtrees/apr-util -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%HOMEPATH%/Libraries/installed
> cmake --build buildtrees/apr-util --target install --config Release
> cmake -S apache-log4cxx-${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_VERSION} -B buildtrees/log4cxx -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%HOMEPATH%/Libraries/installed -DBUILD_TESTING=off
> cmake --build buildtrees/log4cxx --target install --config Release
~~~

3. Build from source and run unit tests in \%HOMEPATH\%/Libraries.
The location of command-line utilities must be provided
to the Log4cxx cmake build in the LOG4CXX_TEST_PROGRAM_PATH cmake variable.
Command-line utilities (zip, grep, sed) are available in Msys2 which can be downloaded
from: https://www.msys2.org/ and by default will be installed under C:/msys64/usr/bin.
~~~
# Install Expat, APR and APR-Util dependencies using the above commands.
> cmake -S apache-log4cxx-${LOG4CXX_RELEASE_VERSION} -B buildtrees/log4cxx -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%HOMEPATH%/Libraries/installed -DLOG4CXX_TEST_PROGRAM_PATH=C:/msys64/usr/bin
> cmake --build buildtrees/log4cxx --config Debug
> cd buildtrees/log4cxx
> ctest --output-on-failure
~~~

## Mac OS/X:

APR and APR-Util are provided by the platform in Mac OS/X 10.5 and iODBC in 10.4.

cmake can be installed by typing "brew install cmake".

CMake can be built from source by typing:

~~~
$ wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.27.2/cmake-3.27.2.tar.gz
$ tar xf cmake-3.27.2.tar.gz
$ cd cmake-3.27.2
$ ./bootstrap
$ make
$ sudo make install
~~~

## FreeBSD:

APR, APR-Util, gzip and zip may be installed from the ports collection by:

~~~
$ cd /usr/ports/archivers/zip
$ make
$ make install
$ cd /usr/ports/archivers/gzip
$ make
$ make install
$ cd /usr/ports/devel/apr
$ make
$ make install
~~~
