    It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP or MD5 signatures.
    Please read {{{https://httpd.apache.org/dev/verification.html}Verifying Apache HTTP Server Releases}} for more
    information on why you should verify our releases.

    The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the {{{https://www.apache.org/dist/logging/KEYS}KEYS}}
    as well as the asc signature file for the relevant distribution. Make sure you get these files from the
    {{{https://www.apache.org/dist/logging/}main distribution directory}}, rather than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using:

---
% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify ${releaseArtifactId}-${releaseVersion}.tar.gz.asc ${releaseArtifactId}-${releaseVersion}.tar.gz
---

        * ${releaseArtifactId}-${releaseVersion} is signed by ${releaseManager} (${releaseKey})

    Alternatively, you can verify the MD5 signature on the files. A unix program called md5 or md5sum is included
    in many unix distributions.

* Previous Releases

  All previous releases of Apache log4cxx can be found in the {{{https://archive.apache.org/dist/logging/log4cxx}archive repository}}.
