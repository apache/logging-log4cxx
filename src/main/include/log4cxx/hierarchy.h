/**
This class is specialized in retrieving loggers by name and also
maintaining the logger hierarchy.

<p><em>The casual user does not have to deal with this class
directly.</em>

<p>The structure of the logger hierarchy is maintained by the
#getLogger method. The hierarchy is such that children link
to their parent but parents do not have any pointers to their
children. Moreover, loggers can be instantiated in any order, in
particular descendant before ancestor.

<p>In case a descendant is created before a particular ancestor,
then it creates a provision node for the ancestor and adds itself
to the provision node. Other descendants of the same ancestor add
themselves to the previously created provision node.
