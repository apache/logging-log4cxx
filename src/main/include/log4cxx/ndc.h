/**
A <em>Nested Diagnostic Context</em>, or #NDC in short, is an instrument
to distinguish interleaved log output from different sources.
Log output is typically interleaved when a server handles multiple
clients near-simultaneously.
Interleaved log output can still be meaningful if each log entry
from different contexts have a distinctive stamp.
This is where contexts come into play.

#NDC provides a constructor and destructor which simply call the #push and
#pop methods, allowing for automatic cleanup when the current scope ends.

#NDC operations such as #push, #pop, #clear and #remove
affect only logging events emitted in the <em>calling</em> thread.
The contexts of other threads are not changed.
That is, <em><b>contexts are managed on a per thread basis</b></em>.

For example, a servlet can build a per client request context
consisting of the client's host name and other information contained in
the the request. <em>Cookies</em> are another source of distinctive
information.

Contexts can be nested:
<ul>
 <li>when entering a context, initialize a <code>log4cxx::NDC</code>
 type variable with a distinctive string.
 If there is no nested diagnostic context for the
 current thread, a NDC stack will be created.
 The distinctive string will be automatically removed from the
 current thread's context stack when the variable goes out of scope.

 <li>when exiting a thread call NDC::remove to deal with any
 #push operation not matched with a corresponding #pop.
</ul>

If configured to do so, PatternLayout, xml::XMLLayout and
JSONLayout instances automatically retrieve the nested diagnostic
context for the current thread without any user intervention.
hence, even if a process is serving multiple clients simultaneously,
the logging events emanating from the same code
(belonging to the same logger)
can still be distinguished because each client
request will have a different tag.

#NDC implements <i>nested diagnostic contexts</i> as
defined by Neil Harrison in the article "Patterns for Logging
Diagnostic Messages" part of the book <i>"Pattern Languages of
Program Design 3"</i> edited by Martin et al.
